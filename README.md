Microsoft Fabric is revolutionizing the way data science is done. With its comprehensive suite of tools, users can now complete end-to-end data science workflows quickly and easily. From data exploration and preparation to experimentation, modeling, and scoring, Microsoft Fabric has you covered. Plus, it allows you to serve predictive insights to BI reports, giving you the insights you need to make informed decisions. With Microsoft Fabric, data science has never been easier.

To enable everyone to start with the notebook experience, below some Notebooks that are using random/public dta and generating a SPARK table in your Lakehouse.

# Prerequisites
Prepare your system for the data science experience.

- A Microsoft Fabric subscription. Or sign up for a free Microsoft Fabric (Preview) trial.https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/fabric/enterprise/licenses
- Sign in to Microsoft Fabric https://fabric.microsoft.com/
- An existing Microsoft Fabric lakehouse. Create a lakehouse by following the steps in Create a lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/fabric/data-engineering/create-lakehouse

# Import notebooks
To enable YOU to start directly with the notebook experience, I have created some Notebooks that you can execute by using random/public data and generating a SPARK table in your Lakehouse.

- Switch to the Data Science experience using the experience switcher icon at the left corner of your homepage.
